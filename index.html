                    You stay in control of the delivery time. Our target is to make sure that your parcel gets to you as soon as you have placed the order. We will continue to notify you by email or text when your parcel is picked up, and all the way to when our rider is approaching your address.

                    However, it's always a good idea to take some precautions when sending a package, such as properly sealing and packaging the contents and, if you must, label the parcel appropriately. If you have any concerns about the security of your parcel, you can contact our customer service team to address any questions or concerns you may have.
